	<div class="about">
		<p> Madame Juneau was born in the isolated mountains of France. Born and raised in a rugged, isolated village, her mother was the local fortune teller. She learned all about contacting the spirits and reading into people's futures from her mother. She now works for us. Want to take a peak into your future? Exchange your coins for stones, and Madame Juneau will read your fortune. With her fortunes come high risks, and with her high risks come high rewards. You may double your stones, receiving double your money, or you may lose all of your stones. </p>
